# cam-save

One of the projects in my image processing courses is actually more of an educational project to record videos from a computer camera with **opencv**.


**Usage :**
- A camera is required to start the project or it will not run
- Once started, you can end the recording process with the q button if you want


**Install :**
```bash
pip install opencv-python
````
